# Technical Assay - Dev Program

## Before you start
* Try not to read ahead.
* Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
* Make sure you only test for correct inputs, there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata.
* Test First!

## Application Description
The current application is oriented to handle a contacts list and the messages you could send to one or many contacts.
It provides the following functionality:

  - User Registration. By opening the URL {server}/signup, you can register in the application. When you enter your email, the app will create a termporal code. You will need to use this temporal code to complete the registration process. Once you enter the temporal code, you will be able to set your username and password.

  - List Contacts. Once you are signed-in in the app, the list contacts page should be displayed.

  - Create a Contact. Within your session, the "Create Contact" option will be visible so you can create a new contact.

  - Send Message. This option lets you to send a single text message to any of your contacts. In the form to create the message, the app should display an option to pick the contact or contacts to send the message to. Also the form will show the "Cancel" button, in case you decided to discard your message.

## Application Structure
This is a REST application, so this repository provides two applications: API and Client.

### API
- JDK 1.8 or higher
- Gradle 7.2 or higher
- Java IDE 

### Client 
- NodeJS 12.18 or higher 
- NPM 6.14

The application is implemented with React.

## Compile and Running the Application
First of all, ensure the ports are correctly configured on both sides.

Compiling API: Go to the `api` folder and run
`$> gradle clean build`

In the `api` folder run:
`$> gradle bootRun`

Open a browser with following URL `http://localhost:8080/`

Compiling Client: Go to the `client` folder and run
`$> npm install`

Running Client: In the `client` folder
`$> npm start`

Open a browser with following URL `http://localhost:3000/`

## Hints
You can use the H2 UI database tool by using the URL `http://localhost:8080/h2-ui`
